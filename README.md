## Instructions

Step 1: Clone repo.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:
```

Step 2: Open in VSC or your code editor and modify signature.html with your information. Make sure any photos you use can be found somewhere on the internet (ie "src" is a url).

Step 3: Open signature.html but copy the local server into a browser that ISN'T CHROME - when you try to copy your signature and paste into Gmail the links will not work from Chrome :( .

Step 4: Select All and Copy your signature. 

Step 5: Open Gmail and under setting scroll down where you find Signature.

Step 6: Create new signature, name it, and Paste in your Signature and save the changes. 


**Note**: There is a limit of 10,000 characters in Gmail Signature. Make sure you don't go too overboard!
